# mkv2mp4

Tested working on windows 10 (x64)
1. Download the .bat file "convert mkv to mp4.bat"
2. Make sure FFMPEG is installed to C:/ffmpeg (if you installed it at a different location, you can edit the .bat file)
3. Place the .bat file in a folder
4. Copy some .mkv files into the same folder
5. Double-click the .bat file and it will begin converting the .mkv files to .mp4 files

It should preserve all of the audio tracks and process fairly quickly. It isn't re-encoding, but just extracting and placing in a new container.

Submit any issues to the issue tracker and hopefully I can help
